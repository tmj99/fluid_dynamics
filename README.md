Latest project I've working on just for fun.

First try using very rudimentary physics of completely elastic collisions. Particles continue to have issue of "stickiness" due to discrete time steps - need to find a way to "push" particles apart.

Will be working on a second try that uses completely different physics involving density based calculations. Hopefully will work better with more interesting results. We shall see.
