Latest project I've working on just for fun.

First try using very rudimentary physics of completely elastic collisions. ~~Particles continue to have issue of "stickiness" due to discrete time steps - need to find a way to "push" particles apart.~~ STICKY IS FIXED. Still have edge cases where balls are stuck together, but much lower likeihood. But was at a heavy computational cost since it requires 2 steps of look-ahead. Still, quite happy with how things turned out.

Will be working on a second try that uses completely different physics involving density based calculations. Hopefully will work better with more interesting results. We shall see.
